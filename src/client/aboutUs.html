        <div style="color:white; text-align: center;" class="row d-flex justify-content-center"><div class="col-md-6"><p style="font-size: 18px;">As a scuba diver, we all share two similar problems, how can I keep track of where I dove, and where are some new places that I can dive? Whether it is forgetting your logbook or researching on the internet new spots  to dive, we have all asked ourselves these questions. This platform will help you answer these questions with the touch of a button.
            The goal of the Diver Now app is to create a platform that will connect the entire scuba dive community and make advancements toward the future. This application will allow divers to: record their dives at the exact site, share their dive experiences with the Diver Now community, help people discover new dive locations, and make the overall experience of exploring the underwater world effortless and enjoyable.
            Creating this application has been a goal of mine for several years and I would not be able to do it without Diver Now's amazing team of developers. As the founder of Diver Now, Peter Tsakonas, I would like to thank the developers Randy Paquette, Jack Hueber, and Charles Hetterich for their countless hours they have put into helping this dream come alive. I would also like to thank David Menarchem for the logo designs used within the app. The team will be adding new features and updates as time goes on in order to make the experience on the Diver Now app even more enjoyable.</p></div></div>
